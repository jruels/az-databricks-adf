### Step-by-Step Guide to Implement the Use Case with Azure Data Factory and Azure Storage Accounts

#### **1. Prerequisites**
- An **Azure Storage Account** to store the source CSV file.
- An **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** instance for orchestrating the data flow.
- Basic knowledge of Azure Data Factory's Data Flow components.

---

### **Step 1: Set Up Azure Resources**

1. **Create an Azure Storage Account**
   - Go to the Azure portal, create a new storage account, and name it (e.g., `mystorageaccount`).
   - In the storage account, create a container (e.g., `input-data`) to hold the source CSV file.
   - Upload your CSV file to the container.

2. **Create an Azure Data Factory Instance**
   - In the Azure portal, create a new Data Factory instance and name it (e.g., `my-data-factory`).
   - Open the Data Factory Studio to start designing your pipeline and data flow.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Pipeline and Data Flow**

1. **Create a Pipeline in ADF**
   - In the Data Factory Studio, go to the "Author" tab.
   - Click **+** > **Pipeline** to create a new pipeline.

2. **Add a Data Flow**
   - Drag a **Data Flow** activity from the activities pane into the pipeline.
   - Click on the data flow activity, and under "Settings," create a new data flow.

### **Step 3: Design the Data Flow**

#### **3.1 Add Source**
1. **Add a Source Transformation**
   - In the Data Flow designer, click **Add Source**.
   - Configure the source to read from your CSV file in the Azure Blob Storage:
     - **Source Type**: Azure Blob Storage.
     - **Linked Service**: Create or use an existing linked service to your Azure Storage Account.
     - **File Path**: Point to the container and file you uploaded earlier.
     - **File Format**: Delimited Text (CSV).
   - **Optimize**: Enable projection to infer column names and types.

---

#### **3.2 Filter Data**
2. **Add a Filter Transformation**
   - After the source, add a **Filter** transformation.
   - Define an expression to filter out rows with null or invalid values:
     - Example: `!isNull(column1) && column1 != '' && column2 > 0`
     - Adjust based on your dataset's structure and cleaning requirements.

---

#### **3.3 Add Derived Columns**
3. **Add a Derived Column Transformation**
   - After filtering, add a **Derived Column** transformation.
   - Define new columns using expressions:
     - **Total Calculation**: Add a column `Total` as the sum of multiple columns:
       ```text
       column1 + column2 + column3
       ```
     - **Type Conversion**: Convert a column to a specific data type:
       ```text
       toInteger(column4)
       ```
     - **Concatenation**: Create a column by concatenating existing columns:
       ```text
       concat(column5, '-', column6)
       ```

---

#### **3.4 Perform Aggregations**
4. **Add an Aggregate Transformation**
   - After the derived column step, add an **Aggregate** transformation.
   - Group data based on a specific column (e.g., `category`).
   - Create aggregate columns:
     - **Sum**:
       ```text
       sum(column_to_sum)
       ```
     - **Count**:
       ```text
       count(group_column)
       ```

---

#### **3.5 Sink Data**
5. **Add a Sink Transformation**
   - Add a **Sink** transformation to write the transformed data to a destination.
   - Configure the sink to write to Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database:
     - **Sink Type**: Azure Blob Storage or another preferred location.
     - **File Path**: Specify the output path (e.g., `output-data` container).
     - **File Format**: Choose the desired format (e.g., CSV or Parquet).

---

### **Step 4: Validate and Publish**
1. Validate the pipeline by clicking **Validate All** in the toolbar.
2. Debug the pipeline to test with a limited data sample.
3. Publish the pipeline to make it available for execution.

---

### **Step 5: Execute the Pipeline**
1. Go to the "Monitor" tab in ADF to trigger the pipeline manually or schedule it via a trigger.
2. Monitor the pipeline execution for any errors.

---

### **Discussion: Sequence of Transformations**
1. **Source**: Read the raw data from a storage account.
2. **Filter**: Perform data cleansing to ensure the data is valid and consistent.
3. **Derived Column**: Add new calculated columns and apply data transformations.
4. **Aggregate**: Group and summarize data to prepare it for analytics or reporting.
5. **Sink**: Write the cleaned, transformed, and aggregated data to the destination.

This sequence ensures data preprocessing happens before transformations and aggregations, leading to efficient and accurate results.

---

### **Tips**
- Use **Debug Mode** in Data Flow to preview the transformations step-by-step.
- Consider using **Data Factory Integration Runtimes** for optimized performance, especially with large datasets.
- For sensitive data, ensure access policies and Azure Key Vault are used for secure credentials management.
